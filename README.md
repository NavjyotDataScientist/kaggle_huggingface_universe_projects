-Make sure dont dive firstly into this before used to with all the tools and concept.

Nav! It’s a great idea to categorize your projects neatly. Here’s a breakdown of some common categories and their subcategories in machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning

Classification

Binary Classification: Predicting one of two classes (e.g., spam vs. not spam)

Multiclass Classification: Predicting one of multiple classes (e.g., digit recognition)

Multi-label Classification: Predicting multiple labels at once (e.g., tagging images with multiple tags)

Regression

Linear Regression: Predicting a continuous value (e.g., house prices)

Logistic Regression: Although it’s used for classification, it’s also a type of regression for probabilities

Polynomial Regression: Non-linear regression with polynomial terms

2. Unsupervised Learning

Clustering

K-Means Clustering: Partitioning data into K clusters

Hierarchical Clustering: Creating a tree of clusters

DBSCAN: Density-based clustering

Dimensionality Reduction

PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reducing dimensions while preserving variance

t-SNE: For visualization of high-dimensional data

Anomaly Detection

Detecting outliers or rare events in data

3. Reinforcement Learning

Value-Based Methods: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

Policy-Based Methods: Policy Gradient, Actor-Critic

Model-Based Methods: Learning a model of the environment
